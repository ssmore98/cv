\section{Patents}
\cventry{U.S. Patent 6,591,287}
                    {Method to increase the efficiency of job sequencing from sequential storage}
                    {This patent describes a technique to efficiently accessing large scientific data sets
                    stored in a magnetic tape library}{}{}{}
\cventry{U.S. Patent 6,715,039}{Cache slot promotion in a replacement queue cache using determinations of probabilities and costs}
{This patent describes a technique to manage data stored in an Integrated Cache Disk Array (ICDA). It is used to determine 
how soon a piece of data will be accessed again}{}{}{}
\cventry{U.S. Patent 6,721,870}{Prefetch algorithm for short sequences}{This patent
    describes a technique to predict future data accesses for a logical volume when the accesses
are small, few and concentrated in a small area. It is used by the microcode in the EMC Symmetrix product line}{}{}{}
\cventry{U.S. Patents 6,769,054 and 7,213,113}
                    {System and method for preparation of workload data for replaying in a data storage environment}
                    {These patents describe a technique to help replicate a customer problem in a lab environment. The
						method takes a trace of the I/O activity in the customer environment and transforms it into
                    an I/O activity trace appropriate for the lab environment}{}{}{}
\cventry{U.S. Patents 6,865,648 and 7,437,515}{Data structure for write pending}
{These patents describe an efficient way to manage dirty data in an Integrated Cache Disk Array (ICDA)}{}{}{}
\cventry{U.S. Patent 6,954,833}{Expedited dynamic mirror service policy}{This
    patent describes a complete overhaul of the Dynamic Mirror Service Policy (DMSP) in the EMC Symmetrix
product line. DMSP is used for orchestrating reading data from RAID-1 devices}{}{}{}
\cventry{U.S. Patent 7,177,853}{Cache management via statistically adjusted time stamp queue}
{This patent forms the basis for the cache management scheme used in EMC Symmetrix product line}{}{}{}
\cventry{U.S. Patent 7,281,086 and 7,293,136}{Management of two-queue request structure for quality of service in disk storage systems}
{These patents describe a method to implement {\em Quality of Service} (QOS) for the disks used by EMC Symmetrix product line}{}{}{}
\cventry{U.S. Patent 8,935,490}{Disk access quality of service}
{This patent describes a method to implement {\em Quality of Service} (QOS) for the disks used by EMC Symmetrix product line}{}{}{}
\cventry{U.S. Patent 7,406,574}{Management of invalid tracks}{This patent
describes a method to find inconsistent pieces of data in a RAID protected
system like the EMC Symmetrix}{}{}{}
\cventry{U.S. Patent 7,552,280}{Asymmetrically interleaving access to
redundant storage devices}{This patent describes an enhancement of the
Dynamic Mirror Service Policy scheme used by EMC Symmetrix to read data from
RAID-1 protected device}{}{}{}
\cventry{U.S. Patent 7,640,342}{System and method for determining configuration of one or more data storage systems}
{The patent describes a method to configure a data storage system based on observed performance 
    metrics. It is employed  in a software used by field personnel for configuring EMC Symmetrix 
data storage system}{}{}{}
\cventry{U.S. Patent 7,882,373}{System and method of reducing power consumption
in a storage system through shortening of seek distances}{}{}{}{}
\cventry{U.S. Patent 8,060,759}{System and method of managing and optimizing
power consumption in a storage system}{}{}{}{}
\cventry{U.S. Patent 9,158,466}{Power-saving mechanisms for a dynamic mirror
service policy}{These patents describe ways to reduce power consumption by hard disk drives in a storage system}{}{}{}
\cventry{U.S. Patent 8,010,738}{Techniques for obtaining a specified lifetime
for a data storage device}{This patent describes a method to ensure that a
NAND-flash based solid state disk will be usable for a specified period of time}{}{}{}
\cventry{U.S. Patent 8,375,187}{I/O scheduling for flash drives}{This patent
describes a technique called modal writes that boosts the performance of
a RAID group made up of flash drives}{}{}{}
\cventry{U.S. Patents 8,566,553 and 8,966,216}{Techniques for automated
evaluation and movement of data between storage tiers}{These patents describe
a technique for managing data movement in a tiered storage array. EMC Corp.'s
VMAX storage array, industry's first tiered storage array, sold software based
on this technique under the brand name FAST v1}{}{}{}
\cventry{U.S. Patent 8,868,798}{Techniques for modeling disk performance}
{This patent describes a technique for modeling disk drive performance in a tiered storage
system. The technique was used in EMC VMAX tiered storage array software sold under the brand name FAST v2}{}{}{}
\cventry{U.S. Patent 8,838,887}
