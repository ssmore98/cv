Having read the description for your opening for Senior Data Infrastructure
Engineer at Vertica, I have determined that this 
position is one where I could make a positive contribution to Vertica.
Thus, I am pleased to share my resume.

My understanding, from evaluating the responsibilities of the role and the
objectives of your company, is that my background could be helpful in
addressing your needs. Specifically, my training includes extensive experience
with C/C++ programming and debugging skills. These have been my primary
development languages and I have worked with them throughout my career,
including but not limited to, when I was involved with the development and
maintenance of two critical simulation software for EMC Symmetrix, one to
simulate the DRAM cache in the storage systems and one the working of multiple
types of hard disk drives. Additionally, Linux was the primary development
platform that I used for over two decades. Moreover, I was immersed in
learning about computer system architecture and operating systems while at EMC
and Infinidat, where I was immersed in system software development work. 

Similarly, it appears that my background in parallel programming would be
useful in this capacity. While at Syracuse University, I developed a
multi-threaded I/O library for IBM SP2 allowing applications to perform
asynchronous I/O Operations to file systems that do not support such operations.
At Northwestern University, I performed system administration for IBM SP2 and
SGI Origin. While at both institutions, I required development of software on
parallel computers, that used MPI and MPI I/O for message passing and
I/O operations. 

Certainly, it is not just technical skills which I would bring to this role.
My background has allowed me to understand the benefits of leadership and
teamwork. It is undeniable, that I come to recognize that a willingness to
exchange new ideas is critical to development. This has been essential to my
analytical, problem-solving and decision-making skills. Indeed, these skills
were maximized when I took the initiative to design an SSD testing regime
called write-pressure testing. Armed with it, we tested several SSDs until
identifying an exceptional SSD from a tiny UK based company. As a result,
EMC Corporation became the first enterprise storage company to offer solid 
state disk storage. And I was honored with the EMC President's Award.

Thank you for your consideration.  I welcome the opportunity to answer any
questions you may have.
