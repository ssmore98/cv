Having read the description for your opening for a Senior C++ Software
Engineer, I have determined that this 
position is one where I could make a positive contribution to Raytheon Technologies.
Thus, I am pleased to share my resume.

My understanding, from evaluating the responsibilities of the role and the
objectives of your company, is that my background could be helpful in
addressing your needs. Specifically, my training includes extensive experience
with C/C++ programming and debugging skills. These have been my primary
development languages and I have worked with them throughout my career,
including but not limited to, when I was involved with the development and
maintenance of two critical simulation software for EMC Symmetrix, one to
simulate the DRAM cache in the storage systems and one the working of multiple
types of hard disk drives. Additionally, Linux was the primary development
platform that I used for over two decades. Moreover, I was immersed in
learning about computer system architecture and operating systems while at EMC
and Infinidat, where I was immersed in system software development work. 

Thank you for your consideration.  I welcome the opportunity to answer any
questions you may have.
