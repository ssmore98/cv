\section{Work Experience}

\cventry{2/2016 - 3/2020}{Consultant Software Technologist}{Infinidat Inc.}
{Waltham, MA} {Platform Research and Development}
{
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Defined and implemented hardware qualification processes for
			hardware components. The development was done in
			\texttt{C/C++/Python} on a \texttt{CentOS Linux} platform. The code
			was maintained under \texttt{GitLab}.
		\item Implemented monitoring services for customer systems. The software
			was written in \texttt{Python} and the data collection was done
			in \texttt{JSON} over a \texttt{REST} API. The collected data was
			analyzed and forecasts were provided to the upper management using
			\texttt{Pandas}, \texttt{numpy} and \texttt{matplotlib}.
	\end{itemize}
}
\cventry{4/2013 - 1/2016}{Consultant Technologist}{EMC Corporation}{Hopkinton, MA}{}
{
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Invented an algorithm for scheduling I/Os to SSDs to improve
			their performance in a RAID configuration.
		\item Designed a new data layout scheme for hard disk drives to improve
			their performance in a tiered storage system.
			The scheme was implemented and tested using an I/O driver written
			in \texttt{C/C++} on \texttt{CentOS Linux} platform using the \texttt{sg} device driver.
	\end{itemize}
}
\cventry{3/2012 - 4/2013}{Consulting Performance Engineer}{EMC Corporation}{Hopkinton, MA}
{Innovation and Systems Engineering, Enterprise Storage Division}
{
	\begin{itemize}
        \item Proposed and implemented the {\em Disk Cloning Appliance} used for bulk
            replacement of faulty disks in a storage array. The appliance was
			developed in \texttt{C++} under \texttt{CentOS Linux} and used \texttt{GTK+} for the user
			interface.
		\item Implemented a simulator to evaluate the proposed metadata paging
			scheme in EMC VMAX Storage System. The software was written in
			\texttt{C++} on a \texttt{CentOS Linux} platform.
	\end{itemize}
}
\cventry{12/2003 - 3/2012}{Principal Performance Engineer}{EMC Corporation}{Hopkinton, MA}{Innovation and Systems
Engineering, Enterprise Storage Division}
{
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Designed and implemented the {\em Secure Erase Appliance for SSDs}
			for the {\em EMC certified secure erase service} as part of the
			launch of SSDs in the EMC storage products lineup. The appliance was
			developed in \texttt{C++} under \texttt{CentOS Linux} and used
			\texttt{GTK+} for the user interface.
		\item Proposed, prototyped and evaluated modifications to the RAID data rebuild algorithm
			in the EMC Symmetrix Storage System to improve its performance when
			the storage system is under heavy load. The
			development was done in \texttt{C} under a proprietary BSD-derived RTOS.
		\item Maintained Cache Simulator software that simulated the behavior of the
			shared memory cache model used by the EMC Symmetrix/VMAX storage system.
			The software was originally written in \texttt{C}. Ported it to \texttt{C++}.
		\item Developed and maintained Hard Disk Simulator software that
			simulated the behavior of different hard disk drives used by the
			EMC Symmetrix/VMAX storage system. The software was written in \texttt{C++}.
	\end{itemize}
}
\cventry{8/2000 - 12/2003}{Senior Performance Engineer}{EMC Corporation}{Hopkinton, MA}{Performance Research Group,
Symmetrix Business Unit}
{
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Proposed, prototyped and evaluated changes to how the EMC Symmetrix Storage System manages dirty data.
			The development was done in \texttt{C} under a proprietary BSD-derived RTOS.
		\item Proposed, prototyped and evaluated a new algorithm in the EMC Symmetrix Storage System schedules read
			operations on disk drives in \texttt{RAID-1} configuration.
			The development was done in \texttt{C} under a proprietary BSD-derived RTOS.
		\item Proposed, prototyped and evaluated enhancement to the existing data pre-fetching algorithm
			in the EMC Symmetrix Storage System for the cases where workloads contain short bursts of
			contiguous data accesses. The development was done in \texttt{C} under a proprietary BSD-derived RTOS.
		\item Prototyped and evaluated changes to the multi-LRU caching mechanism int the EMC Symmetrix Storage
			System to strike a better balance between the performance (retaining frequently accessed data) and the cost
			(memory accesses needed to retain data in the cache).
			The development was done in \texttt{C} under a proprietary BSD-derived RTOS.
