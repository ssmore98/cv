\cventry{10/1994 - 8/1996}{Research Assistant}{Department of Electrical and
Computer Engineering}{Syracuse University}{Syracuse, NY}{
Designed and evaluated a multi-threaded runtime library for parallel I/O.
It separated the compute and I/O tasks in two separate threads of control.
Multi-threading in the design permits:
\begin{itemize}
	\item asynchronousI/O even if the
underlying file system does not support asynchronous I/O
\item  copy avoidance from the I/O thread to the compute thread by sharing address
space 
\item a capability to perform collective I/O asynchronously without 
blocking the compute threads.
\end{itemize}
The library also implements collective I/O which maximize load balance and
concurrency while reducing communication overhead in an integrated  fashion.
The library was evaluated on IBM SP2 for various data distributions and
access patterns. The results show that there is a tradeoff between the amount of
concurrency in I/O and the buffer size designated for I/O; and there is an
optimal buffer size beyond which benefits of larger requests diminish due to
large communication overhead.}
